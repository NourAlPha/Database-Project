The Sports Association website is a web-based platform created to serve as the association's main database. This website aims to give users an easy way to browse clubs, games, fixtures, results, and other relevant information on a single platform.

Users can examine the data on the website in a structured and user-friendly way by logging in with their specific credentials.

The website was created utilising the ASP.NET Core framework in C#, a platform for web development that is highly scalable and reliable. The website is made to be accessible and responsive to ensure that can access it from any device, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
